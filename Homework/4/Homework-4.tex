\section*{Question 13.2}
Consider an RS-232 controller with no interrupt capability.
If we are to support a 19,200 bps data rate with seven data bits, even parity, and one stop bit, how often should we poll the controller?
If each polling operation takes 200 $\mu$S, what fraction of the system's time is spent polling?
\newline

\section*{Question 13.4}
When using DMA, does the device driver still need an interrupt handler?
Why or why not?
If yes, then what are the differences between an interrupt handler for a controller that uses DMA and a handler for on that doesn't?
\newline

\section*{Question 13.6}
If an Ethernet controller does not use DMA but generates an interrupt for every byte, and if each interrupt takes 10 $\mu$S to process, then can the system effectively use the 10 Mbit/S data rate?
Why or why not?
\newline

\section*{Question 13.8}
What is the benefit of using the elevator algorithm?
How does it accomplish this?

\section*{Question 15.2}
In the extended binary coded decimal interchange code (EBCDIC), the letters are not contiguous
(for example, there are character values between the letters "i" and "j").
However, the difference between an uppercase letter and the corresponding lowercase one is still a constant.
What technique for handling the Caps Lock, used in $i8042intr$(), still work for EBCDIC?
Why or why not?
\newline
No since for values that are between letters they would get converted to their "Uppercase" variant which wouldn't make sense.
(I think need to look at code again)

\section*{Question 15.6}
In $outch$(), while waiting for the port to become ready, we don't enable interrupts for the first 10 tries at 1 mS each.
Why not just start directly sleeping 100 mS at a time and let an interrupt wake us up?

\section*{Question 17.4}
Is it necessary to provide both absolute and relative position seeking service?
Why or why not?
\newline

\section*{Question 17.7}
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a double-indirect pointer over multiple single-indirect pointers?
\newline

\section*{Question 17.9}
If we have a three-level tree-structured allocation structure as in Figure 17-8, where each block is 1024 bytes and each block pointer is 4 bytes, how large is the largest file that can be represented?
\newline

\section*{Question 17.11}
Describe how symbolic links could be implemented?
