Testing procedure:

Run test1 in the background with default parent quanta.
Set quanta of prog/1/ to some value.
Run "time fib" which will inherit new value from prog/1
Compare "time fib" across different quanta variations.

Findings:
If the quanta's match then timing was pretty consistent.
If test1 quanta was decently larger than fib then fib ran slower.
If fib quanta was decently larger than test1 then fib ran quicker.

So if a process has a larger relative quanta compared to all other processes then it will run "faster" than if it had the same quanta as everything else.
