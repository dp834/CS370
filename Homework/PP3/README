Removed all references to the tree of free memory in alloc.c
Then went through function by function and reimplemented the logic for a linked list.
After making it compile for the first time I had to trace through my code to find bugs which I did by adding prints for functions and seeing which function it was seg faulting on.
After getting inferno to boot completely I ran some limbo programs to make sure things were still functioning as well as large array allocations.
Everything seemed to be functioning as before so I assume that all the changes worked.
